							<h1>Data Visualization of Macro-nutrients in Fast Food</h1>
							<h3>Objective</h3>
							<p>
								We wanted to create a visualization to help the user
								choose the healthiest fast food options. We all know fast food
								isn't good for us, but we continue to eat it anyway, and so 
								harm reduction in this sphere has a valuable role. Our set of
								requirements was that we should be able to visually compare
								nutritional contents between specific "meals"(collection of selected
								food items) at the same or different
								restaurants.
							</p>
							<h3>My Role</h3>
							<p>
								This project was completed by me and two other group members. We all took
								part evenly in the prototyping process, and selecting which designs to go
								forward with. The final implementation was largely completed by myself (given
								the barriers of collaboration during quarantine), with the collection and
								referencing of icons done by my team members.
							</p>
							<h3>Technologies</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>HTML / CSS</li>
								<li>JavaScript</li>
								<li>D3</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>
							We began our design process by sketching, and decided to move forward
							on a visualization that resembles a tree map. 
							</p>
							<img src="images/DataVis/sketch.png" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								From here we started creating a handful of variants with D3 that worked
								with the entire data set.
							</p>
							<img src="images/DataVis/proto1.png" class="proj_img">
							
							<img src="images/DataVis/proto2.png" class="proj_img">
							<p>The visualization above was the inspiration for the final project.</p>
							<img src="images/DataVis/proto3.png" class="proj_img">
							<p>This circular treemap was my personal favorite, I'm interested in perhaps
								utilizing this visualization scheme on another data set.
							</p>
							<h3>Outcome</h3>
							<p>
								Though there is definitely a lack of aesthetic polish to this visualization,
								I think this solution had a wide range of intuitive interactions that met our goals. 
								The visualization consists of each food item having a representative rectangle on 
								each of the four macro-nutrient bars. The user can hover over each rectangle
								or corresponding icon below to get more info about the specific food item.
							</p>
							<img src="images/DataVis/hover.png" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								There are many ways to select items, the user can toggle click a specific item
								to select and deselect it. This selection is additive, and subsequent selections
								can be made. The respective macro-nutrient quantities are 
								described in their appropriate units at the end of each bar.
								For convenience there are also select all and clear buttons.
							</p>
							<img src="images/DataVis/selected.png" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								The user also has the ability to zoom and pan each of the two
								canvases around so they can select the smaller rectangles easily.
								Overall i'm quite happy with the feature set of the project. I would
								have preferred the visuals to have been based off the circular treemap
								prototype, but the connected stacked bars have great visual appeal as
								well.

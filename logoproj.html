							<h1>Logo design for app that gets you lost</h1>
							<h3>Objective</h3>
							<p>
								This project was completed while I attended SFU for their Interactive Arts and Technology
								Program. The goal was to iteratively create and refine a logo for a random app idea. The idea
								I chose was a map app that would purposefully get the user lost. 
							</p>
							<h3>My Role</h3>
							<p>
								This was a solo project, but I had lots of constructive input from my instructors and peers. 
							</p>
							<h3>Skills</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
								<li>Ideation</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>
							This endeavor started with ideation. I brainstormed associated words and then sketched related images.
							</p>
							<img src="images/Logo/sketch1.jpg" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								I then iterated on my best sketches and refined them more.
							</p>
							<img src="images/Logo/sketch2.jpg" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								The next step was to design a logo without color, and to critique it at smaller sizes. This allowed clarity to be
								the primary design goal. It became quickly obvious if the idea was too complex.
							</p>
							<img src="images/Logo/prototype.png" class="proj_img">
							This was my first attempt. It was inspired by question marks, roads, and used the very well known location marker.
							 This was an adequate first attempt, but the next step was to take in constructive criticism and
							introduce color.
							<img src="images/Logo/splash.jpg" class="proj_img">
							
							<h3>Remarks</h3>
							<p>
								The colors I used here were blue and beige, which I associated with maps. The red of the marker seemed like the most
								common coloring of the location marker, and added mor vibrancy to the logo.
							</br>
								
								This was a completely new process and skillset to me at the time, and I learned a lot about effective
								design process with this project. Logo design is still probably something I'm quite weak at, but this 
								exercise was very valuable in giving me a design vocabulary to work with.

							<h1>Magazine Spread</h1>
							<h3>Objective</h3>
							<p>
								The goal was to design a layout for five spreads that had a minimun number of words, 
								utilized whitespace well, and had 
								appropriate design language for the subject matter.
							</p>
							<h3>My Role</h3>
							<p>
								This was a school team project with two other members. I designed two of the spreads.
							</p>
							<h3>Technologies</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Adobe InDesign</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>
								Like many of my other design projects I started out with sketching, and then moving forward with the
								best layouts.
							</p>
							<img src="images/Motorcycle/sketch_1.jpg" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								We then collected all the necessary images and decided on some design elements that we would incorporate
								into our spreads. This included many diagonal lines, and ribbon type graphics that created depth.
							</br> I designed the two spreads below.
							</p>
							<img src="images/Motorcycle/spread_2.jpg" class="proj_img">
							<img src="images/Motorcycle/spread_3.jpg" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								My team members designed the spreads below.
							</p>
							<img src="images/Motorcycle/spread_1.jpg" class="proj_img">
							<img src="images/Motorcycle/spread_4.jpg" class="proj_img">
							<img src="images/Motorcycle/spread_5.jpg" class="proj_img">


							<h3>Remarks</h3>
							<p>
								This project primarily taught me the importance of white space for increasing readability, and 
								guiding the viewers eye. It influences any interface I design to this day, because I often find my human
								instinct wants to add more graphical elements, but complexity doesn't equal quality. Personally I wasn't a fan 
								of the subject matter, and the design language that followed it, but I do think it was appropriate for it.

								<h3>Bio</h3>
								<p>
									My name is Chandler Bullock and I am a recent graduate from
									the University of Calgary. I earned my Bsc. in Computer Science in 
									2020. There I experimented with human computer interaction, and also worked a lot with
									 databases. I completed projects utilizing machine learning, created user applications with complicated back-end systems,
									and experimented with visualizing large data sets. 
								</p>
								<h3>Experience</h3>
								<p>
									I've been working as an intern at Eidetic Communications, a small startup,
									for the last year. We develop compute accelerators to drive cost savings
									and performance gains for large data centers. At Eideticom I've been able to develop
									an array of visualization and reporting tools to give management and other developers
									better visibility of our product's performance. I've also been instrumental in creating and managing
									continuous integration pipelines for our core repositories.
								</p>
								<h3>Goals</h3>
								<p>
									My career goals are to expand my understanding of web technologies, and sharpen my
									design skills. I feel confident with my experience that I can master any programming
									language or technical tool. With that as my foundation I'm looking to dive deeper into the 
									visual design and user experience problem space. I have found exploring the field of
									design and bridging it with my technical expertise to be extremely gratifying. I hope to
									one day have a comprehensive understanding of what makes digital products successful.
								</p>
								<h3>Hobbies</h3>
								<p>
									I tend to subscribe to the quantity over quality ideology when it comes to hobbies. 
									Some hobbies have managed to stick around through my capricious behavior though. 
									I'm a lover of the outdoors and try to get out to the mountains often. Primarily to hike, 
									but sometimes to climb. During quarantine I've taken up running and am aiming to run a 
									25 minute 5k before the end of summer (turns out running is very hard and I'm no where close yet).
									I enjoy playing very easy songs on the guitar and singing out of tune. More recently I've been
									trying to get back into drawing, which I mostly stopped once I started university, and it's felt
									very rewarding to rekindle childhood passions.

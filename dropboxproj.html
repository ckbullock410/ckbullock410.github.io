							<h1>Dropbox for Students and Teachers</h1>
							<h3>Objective</h3>
							<p>
								This project was completed for a Database class. Our plan was to create a 
								file storage and sharing application that could keep track of ownership, 
								permissions, relevant classes, and other details. 
							</p>
							<h3>My Role</h3>
							<p>
								Me and two other group members created a database schema together, and then I 
								designed and created much of the core application. My group members created the login/register
								screens and functionality, as well as the views for professors to add new courses and sections.
							</p>
							<h3>Technologies</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>HTML / CSS</li>
								<li>JavaScript</li>
								<li>PHP</li>
								<li>MySQL</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>
							Since the priority for this project was database management, it started with the design of a schema. This took some
							trial and error to get a usable relational model.
							</p>
							<img src="images/Dropbox/model.png" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								All that was left after that was to slowly implement each feature of the application. We needed the ability for the user
								to login / register, upload / share / delete files, and keep a modicum of security between users.
							</br>*I apologize as my team member deleted the project from github, so I only have screenshots from the project report.
							</p>

							<p>
								Once the user is logged in, they can start to upload files.
							</p>
							<img src="images/Dropbox/addFile.png" class="proj_img">
							<p>If the user is a teacher they can also add courses for students to relate their files to.</p>
							<img src="images/Dropbox/addCourse.png" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								We decided it would also be a helpful feature if the user could organize their files into collections, so 
								I added 'directories' that could contain discrete file sets.
							</p>
							<img src="images/Dropbox/organization.png" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								Lastly we added functionality for sorting, downloading, sharing, and deleting files.
							</p>
							<img src="images/Dropbox/share.png" class="proj_img">
							<p>
								The user can click the icon on the left, and type a username to share the file. Click the blue filename to download,
								click the down arrow next to the field name to sort by that criteria, and there are x's next to every file that
								enable the user to delete it.
							</p>
							<h3>Remarks</h3>
							<p>
								Other than some aging font and icon choices, I'm quite proud of this project. It required a diverse set of skills
								and a depth of learning as well. It taught me a lot about database management and was my first real experience with 
								user flows. I really enjoyed thinking about all the branching paths a user needed to take to successfully use the 
								application.
